    <h1>Trip to Europe</h1>
    <p>I was lucky enough to visit Europe last year and wanted to share some of my experiences and photos</p>
    <p>Some of the countries I visited were:</p>
    <!-- list of countries -->
    <ol>
      <li>United Kingdom</li>
      <li>Italy</li>
      <li>Greece</li>

    <h1>United Kingdom</h1>
    <p>Living just north of London was perfect, as we were close enough to train into London for the day, but also had easy access to the M1 and M25.
    We could easily drive anywhere, and also had a train line passing directly through the town.</p>

    <p>Greece was our first major trip away, and after a cold half-term in England we were happy to get to the much milder climate of Greece!</p>
